Description: Some tools for cleaning up messy 'Excel' files to
    be suitable for R. People who have been working with 'Excel' for years
    built more or less complicated sheets with names, characters, formats
    that are not homogeneous. To be able to use them in R nowadays, we
    built a set of functions that will avoid the majority of importation
    problems and keep all the data at best.
